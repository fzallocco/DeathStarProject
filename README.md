# 3D Animation of Death Star from Star Wars using Legacy and Web-based Technologies

## Project Description

To further understand the applications of vector products in the context of shading and lightning in C & C++, I decided to replicate 3D Animation of the Death Star from Star Wars. Due to the fact that native code is platform-dependent, I also added a platform-independent JavaScript/React version of the same program that outputs the animation to your default web browser at the port `http://localhost:3000`.

Below are interesting resources covering how the C compiler performs Math calculations featured in the donut program:

## Resources

I found the Death Star's C & JavaScript code on Rosettacode.org, and I adapted the JavaScript version to fit into a React project for portability for mobile devices. I used ChatGPT to understand the innerworkings of both versions, and after a few trials and errors I was able to retrieve working React code for the rotating sphere, moving away from ASCII characters characteristic to the C language and adopting radial gradients typical of web-based technologies like JavaScript & React.

## IMPORTANT 

I do not own the IP of the Star Wars content or the code published in this project.
I do not profit, or plan to, from Star Wars content I published or will publish as much as I do not earn anything from publishing this code. This is purely for education and scientific/engineering research.
