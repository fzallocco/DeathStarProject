# 3D Animation of Death Star from Star Wars using Legacy and Web-based Technologies

## Project Description

To further understand the applications of vector products in the context of shading and lightning in C & C++, I decided to replicate 3D Animation of the Death Star from Star Wars. Due to the fact that native code is platform-dependent, I also added a platform-independent JavaScript/React version of the same program that outputs the animation to your default web browser at the port `http://localhost:3000`.
